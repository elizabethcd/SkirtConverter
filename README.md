# SkirtConverter

Work in progress

1. Download Python and install it for your OS
2. Download the source code and unzip it
3. Make a folder named `input` inside the source code file
4. Place any .pngs inside the `input` folder, named with something related to the final skirt name. PNGs must have the dimensions and layout of the vanilla pants items, meaning they are 192 by 688 pixels. By default, the script pulls from the right side (female farmer base), but you can set a flag ``--rightHalf False`` to pull from the left side instead. 
5. In the output folder, some folders will be generated. You can place these in a folder named `Pants` in an FS mod folder. You may need to do some small tweaks.
